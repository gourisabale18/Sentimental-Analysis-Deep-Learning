## Sentimental-Analysis-Deep-Learning

Through this project we are aiming to perform sentimental analysis of student's comments on RateMyProfessors website https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/. Our primary goal is to predict the quality and difficulty scores for professor's teaching using recurrent neural network(RNN) in deep learning.
This information would help future students to take the review the course and its professor's teaching before taking the course.

### Tech Stack Used
1. Python
2. Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM, GRUs 
3. Keras, TensorFlow
4. Data science libraries such as Numpy,Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikitlearn
7. Jupyter Notebook
8. Google Collab
9. One hot encoder, Glove embeddings, word2vec

### Tasks we performed:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Word Emebeddings using glove and word2vec
4. Split the datasets into training and testing sets
5. Train the main model
6. Analyse the results by comparing the models and select the best model for prediction
