## Sentimental-Analysis-Deep-Learning

Through this project we are performing sentimental analysis of comments using sample datasets of RateMyProfessors website. Our primary goal is to predict the quality and difficulty scores for professor's teaching based on the comments provided by students.

### Tasks we performed:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Word Emebeddings using glove and word2vec
4. Split the datasets into training and testing sets
5. Train the main model
6. Analyse the results by comparing the models and select the best model for prediction

Guide to execute the project: 

1. Download the ipynb file.
2. This file already contains the results of sentimental analysis done to predict the quality and difficulty of scores.
3. If you want to rerun the entire file, copy the code block by block in google colab notebook /jupyter notebook and run it.
4. Copy the json file and csv file in root folder to local drive of colab for accessing data.
5. Run the code block by block to see the result.
